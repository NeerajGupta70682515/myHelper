                                            We, at HBF NIDHI LTD believe that clean and hygienic conditions at schools and work places are prerequisites for the future of a developed and blooming India. Aligning ourselves with Mahatma Gandhi's dream project of a clean and filth-free India, we have undertaken several initiatives to work shape a favourable learning environment in the schools of rural India. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            In line with the Swachh Bharat campaign, one of our primary focus areas under CSR, is creating conducive environment for children in schools. In partnership with 8 not-for-profit organisations across 8 states of Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Meghalaya, we have covered more than 850 Government schools touching over 1.16 lakhs students. Our focus is not only in providing sanitation infrastructure but it also encompasses behavioural change (WASH-Water, Sanitation and Health). We believe that the family and school play a key role in shaping a child’s life and hence our WASH programme integrates these stakeholders into bringing a sustainable behavioural change in school as well as at community level. Besides, we have also provided facilities for potable water as well as improvement in basic infrastructure in schools.

                                            HBF NIDHI LTD recognises education as the most significant intervention in the overall economic and social development of the society. We aim to reach 'every child in school and learning' through our initiatives by enabling and ensuring quality education in the most remote parts of the nation to the maximum number of beneficiaries. We believe that the power of education can only be realised with a combined progress of schools, teachers and students. The Bank also identifies its responsibility to spread financial literacy and has undertaken projects to promote the same among the members of the society. Through our interventions, we have touched more than 60,000 students and 2 lakh teachers across 11 states of India.

                                        Communities are the pivot of all our rural initiatives and we believe that in order to bring a sustainable change, communities must be economically and socially empowered. Our rural development programmes focus in the areas of Financial Literacy and Inclusion, Improvement of Education and infrastructure, Sustainable Livelihood through skill development and Natural Resource Management, Water and Sanitation, Health and Environment and Energy. Our interventions range from arid regions of Marathwada in Maharashtra, to rain fed areas of Meghalaya, from desert lands of Rajasthan to the coastal areas of Tamil Nadu and currently span over 206 villages across 7 states of Meghalaya, Assam, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand.

We have rejuvenated existing structures like ponds, wells, constructed check-dams, adopted soil and water treatment measures through net planning. This has led to not only better agricultural produce but also to an increase in water availability for domestic use and raise in the ground water table. Additionally, we have improved soil quality in 317hc.of land and have reduced soil and water erosion. In the process we have ensured active community participation.</p>
